#Shiny DLMtool
*Offer user specified effort series for MSE
*Improve indiactor running MSE
*Improve speed by consolidating certain runs
*Clear for new data file
*Make meaningful methods names
*Add age and lengths comps to the data tab
*Add stock inputs that would use the DLMobject inputs
*Add run indicator for the TAC tab
*Add composite TAC values download
*Add list of MPs even when dlm object is not there
*Magic button for deterministic run: Make SDs 0, make LH values same for both slider values. Work with Chantel to make sure fleet and 
*VOI plot: # of MPs to plot-- is this redundant to the "Choose methods for the Kobe, projection and VOI plots"
*When custsomizing your stock, fleet and Obs inputs, have a choice to save them.
*Add inputs in the MP methods for TAC and MSE sections 
*Check sensitivity plots for extension of the range of values.

#Shiny Natural mortality tool
*Add the equations as a pop-up
*Add references

#Improvements to DLMtool R package
age-specific M
coorelations in paramter draws
Ask whether year-specific M is doable in DLMtool

MSE improvements: 
Need user-specified reference points.
Better transparency of reference points.
Add crustsacean example for stock OM
Make a deterministic run easy to do
